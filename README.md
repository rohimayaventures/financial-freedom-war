## 🔥 The Problem We're Solving

262,000+ tech workers were laid off in 2024. The job search takes 3-6 months on average. But the REAL problem?

**Tech workers' brains never shut off.**

They check LinkedIn at 2 AM, apply to 100+ jobs weekly, neglect health and family, and burn out before they even interview. The harder they try, the worse they do. **85% report severe burnout and anxiety during their search.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**LayoffToLiftoff is an AI Executive Function Assistant** that:

- 🤖 **Handles 70-90% of your job search automatically**
- 📅 **Forces life balance** (auto-blocks family/health time)
- 🧠 **Turns your brain off** so you can actually rest
- 📊 **Adapts to your stress levels** daily
- 🎓 **Graduates you** from layoff to liftoff in 30-90 days

Every morning at 7 AM: "Here are your 3 tasks today. Do these, then STOP."

**You can't burn out because we won't let you.**

## 📜 License

MIT License - See LICENSE file for details

**TL;DR:** Use it, modify it, build on it. Just don't be a jerk. 😊

## 💕 The Origin Story

This started because of **PP (Prasad Pagade)**. When he got laid off, his wife Hannah watched him struggle. His brilliant brain wouldn't shut off. His health declined. Family time suffered.

She thought: *"What if AI just... handled this for him?"*

LayoffToLiftoff was born from love, built for PP, designed for millions.

**Not to beat him in a battle. To save him from burnout.**

And if it helps him, it can help millions of people just like him.
